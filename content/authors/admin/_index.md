Hi, thank you for viewing my website. My name is Yiyuan. You can also call me Gracie. I am highly interested in handling all types of data to answer convoluted research questions with logic and accuracy. My internship at Nielsen and Deloitte confirms this. In my leisure time, reading counts a lot, where at least one hour is spent every day exploring a totally different lifestyle, value, and experiences from mine.(My annual reading report gets over ten thousands page views on Douban.) 

Such nature of detecting a whole picture from small pieces and trying to understand others corresponds to the thrill I achieve when solving every research problems. The passion I have turns to a huge motivator for my job. My decent work grants me recommendation letters from former colleagues and employers. Please feel free to reach me for more!
